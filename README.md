# Netflix_Clone
This project is a self-contained Netflix clone built using a single HTML file. It uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic functionality. The project's main goal is to replicate the front-end user experience of the Netflix website, including a responsive design and an interactive user interface.
